//! Consuming a small JSON body through a pool of four workers: the loop hands each delivery to a
//! free worker, which decodes it, runs the handler and acks. The runtime is the single-threaded
//! one every scenario here runs on, so the workers are tasks of it and the count is exact; what a
//! pinned pool costs on worker threads is the wall-clock bench's to show.
