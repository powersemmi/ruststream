//! Subscription descriptors: how a handler is bound to one broker subscription.
//!
//! A [`SubscriptionSource`] is the value a broker crate exposes as its subscriber configuration:
//! it carries everything needed to open one subscription (subject / name, consumer group,
//! durable name, delivery policy, ...) and knows how to turn that into a live [`Subscriber`]
//! against a connected broker. The default [`Name`] source covers brokers that only need a name
//! string (those implementing [`Subscribe`]); richer brokers ship their own sources.
//!
//! This is the seam the `#[subscriber(..)]` macro and the application object build on: the macro
//! takes a source (a name string or a broker config value), the runtime resolves it once against
//! the [`ConnectedBroker`] form produced by [`Broker::connect`](crate::Broker::connect).

/// A description of one subscription, resolved against a connected broker at startup.

/// The runtime calls [`subscribe`] once, against the [`ConnectedBroker`] witness produced by
/// [`Broker::connect`](crate::Broker::connect), to obtain the live [`Subscriber`]. The associated
/// [`Subscriber`](Self::Subscriber) type lives on the source rather than the broker, so a single
/// broker can offer several subscription kinds with different subscriber types (for example
/// `Redis` pub/sub versus streams).
